                With specific reference to third party advertising, we use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a 'pixel tag', which is industry standard technology used by most major websites.

                Customer name, address, phone number, traveller's name and age are shared with applicable service providers like the airlines, hotels, etc., for the purpose of reservation and booking the services for the customer/traveller.

These details are also shared with certain third parties only for the purpose of processing 'Cash Back & Discounts'. Information like Phone number, E-mail address and billing address may be used for promotional purposes, unless the customer/user has unsubscribed from such services.
